I am a senior cybersecurity major with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in technology started in a different field, but my passion for cybersecurity led me to pursue a degree in this ever-evolving industry. I have gained hands-on experience through my role at ODU IT Network Services and my SOC Analyst training at Sentinel Cyber Institute. I am eager to apply my skills in security monitoring, threat analysis, and incident response as I work toward joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
